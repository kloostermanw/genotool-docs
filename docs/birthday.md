# Birthday / Age

# Birthday

The birthday field is essential for determining the order in which children are displayed. They are arranged from left to right, starting with the oldest on the left and progressing to the youngest on the right. This ensures that the visual representation of the children follows their chronological order.

If you're unsure of a child's exact birthday or prefer not to provide it, you can opt to use the age field instead. This option can be enabled through the settings menu, allowing you to input only the age, which will still maintain the correct order of display.

Please note that either the birthday or age field must be filled in to ensure the children are displayed in the correct sequence.
