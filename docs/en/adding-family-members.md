2. In the detail panel, click **Add Partner**.

### With a New Partner

To add a child while also creating a new partner:

3. Both a new partner and a new child are created, with the appropriate relation lines drawn automatically.

## Adding Parents

To add parents to a person:

1. Select the person in the drawing.

3. Two new persons (father and mother) are created above the selected person, connected by relation lines.

## Adding Alternative Parents

GenoTool supports multiple sets of parents for situations such as foster care or adoption:

2. Click **Add Other Parents**.
3. Choose the parent type (e.g., foster parents, adoptive parents).
4. A new set of parents is created and linked to the person.

Alternative parents are positioned with an offset from the primary parents to keep the drawing clear.

## Adding Twins

### Adding Twins to a Relationship

To add twin children to an existing partnership:

1. Select one of the two partners.
2. Click **Add Twins**.
3. Two new persons are created as children, linked together as twins.

### Adding a Twin Sibling

To add a twin sibling to an existing child:

1. Select the child who already exists in the drawing.
2. Click **Add Twin Brother/Sister**.
3. A new person is created and linked as a twin to the selected child.

!!! note
    You can specify whether twins are identical or fraternal in the person's **Extra** section. See [Setting Up a Person](setting-up-person.md) for more details.

## Automatic Positioning

When working in **Auto mode**, GenoTool automatically repositions persons in the drawing after adding new family members. This ensures proper spacing and prevents overlap.

If the drawing becomes too complex for automatic positioning, GenoTool will show a warning and suggest switching to **Manual mode**. See [Canvas Settings](canvas-settings.md) for more information on positioning modes.
