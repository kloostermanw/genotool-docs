# Canvas Settings

GenoTool offers several settings to customize how your genogram is displayed and how persons are positioned on the canvas.

## Positioning Mode

GenoTool supports two positioning modes:

### Auto Mode

In **Auto mode**, GenoTool automatically calculates the positions of all persons and relations in the drawing. When you add a new family member, the layout is recalculated to maintain proper spacing and avoid overlap.

Auto mode is enabled by default and is recommended for most genograms.

!!! note
    If your drawing becomes very complex, auto positioning may not find an ideal layout. In that case, GenoTool will suggest switching to Manual mode.

### Manual Mode

In **Manual mode**, you have full control over the position of every person and relation. You can drag persons to any location on the canvas.

To switch between modes, use the **Auto/Manual** toggle in the settings. The current mode is displayed in the toolbar.

## Grid

The grid helps you align persons neatly on the canvas. When the grid is enabled, persons snap to grid positions as you move them.

The grid can be toggled in `Settings > General`.

## Person Size

The **person size** setting controls how large the person symbols (squares, circles) are drawn on the canvas. Adjusting this affects the overall scale of the genogram.

Configure person size in `Settings > General`.

## Distance Settings

Several distance settings control the spacing between elements in the drawing:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Distance between partners** | The horizontal space between two partners in a relationship. |
| **Distance between children** | The horizontal space between sibling children. |
| **Distance between persons** | The general spacing between persons. |
| **Distance person and relation** | The vertical distance between a person and the relation line. |

These settings are especially useful in Auto mode, where they influence the automatic layout calculations. Adjust them in the drawing settings.

## Line Width

The **line width** setting controls the thickness of the lines drawn between persons (relation lines, child lines, etc.). A larger value makes lines more visible, while a smaller value creates a more subtle appearance.

## Reposition

When in Auto mode, you can trigger a manual **Reposition** to recalculate the layout of the entire drawing. This is useful if you have made changes and want the layout to be optimized again.

Click the **Reposition** button in the toolbar to recalculate positions.
