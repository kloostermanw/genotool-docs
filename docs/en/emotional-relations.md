# Emotional Relations

Emotional relations describe the interpersonal dynamics between any two persons in a genogram. Unlike [family relations](family-relations.md), emotional relations are not about formal partnerships but about the quality of the connection between individuals.

1. Select a person in the drawing.
2. In the detail panel, navigate to the **Emotional Relations** section.
