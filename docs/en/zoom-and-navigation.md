# Zoom & Navigation

GenoTool provides zoom and pan controls to help you navigate large genograms and focus on specific areas of your drawing.

## Zoom In / Zoom Out

Use the zoom controls in the toolbar to adjust the view:

- Click the **+** button to zoom in.
- Click the **-** button to zoom out.

You can also use your mouse scroll wheel to zoom in and out.

Zooming adjusts the scale of the entire drawing, making symbols and text larger or smaller.

!!! note
    Zooming does not change the actual size of the genogram. It only changes how it is displayed on screen. To change the size of person symbols, use the **Person Size** setting in [Canvas Settings](canvas-settings.md).

## Panning

To move around the canvas:

- Click and drag on an empty area of the canvas to pan in any direction.

This is useful for navigating larger genograms that extend beyond the visible area.
