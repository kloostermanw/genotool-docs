# Export & Import

GenoTool allows you to export your drawings as image files or as data files, and to import drawings from previously exported files.

## Download as JPG

To save your genogram as an image:

1. Open the drawing you want to export.
2. Click the **Download as JPG** button in the toolbar.
3. The genogram is saved as a JPG image file to your device.

This is useful for sharing your genogram with others or for including it in reports and presentations.

## Export as JSON

To export your drawing in GenoTool's own format:

1. Navigate to the drawing overview page.
2. Click the **Export** icon next to the drawing you want to export.
3. A JSON file is downloaded with a filename in the format `genotool-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-drawingname.json`.

The exported file contains all drawing data, including:

- All persons and their details
- Family relations
- Emotional relations
- Groups and group memberships
- Drawing settings
- Positions and layout
- Twin relationships
- Alternative parents

!!! note
    Exporting as JSON is the best way to create a backup of your drawing or to transfer it to another team.

## Import from JSON

To import a previously exported drawing:

1. Navigate to the drawing overview page.
2. Click the **Import** button.
3. Select a GenoTool JSON file from your device (maximum 10 MB).
4. The drawing is created with all persons, relations, and settings from the file.

After import, you are redirected to the newly created drawing.

!!! note
    The import feature requires admin permissions on the team.
