### Important Note:
If the individuals in the group are not positioned closely together in the drawing, this may result in unusual or distorted shapes when visualizing the group. Keep this in mind when organizing persons into groups, as it can affect the appearance of the overall layout.

By organizing persons into groups, you can better manage related members and ensure a more structured view.
