# Family Relations

Family relations represent the formal or informal partnerships between two persons in a genogram. GenoTool supports a wide range of relationship types, each displayed with a distinct line style between the two partners.

## Adding a Family Relation

Family relations are created when you add a partner to a person. See [Adding Family Members](adding-family-members.md) for how to add partners, children, and parents. The default relation type for a new partnership is **Marriage**.

To change the relation type after adding a partner:

1. Select one of the persons in the drawing.
2. In the detail panel on the left, navigate to the **Relations** section.
3. Choose the desired relationship type from the dropdown.

The relation line between the two persons will update to reflect the selected type.
