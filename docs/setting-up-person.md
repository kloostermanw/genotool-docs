# Person

When you click on a person in the genogram, the following fields and details are available for viewing and editing.

## Names

A person can have multiple names recorded. The most important name is the **first name**, as this is the name that will appear in the drawing. The **last name** and **maiden/birth name** are recorded for reference but do not appear in the diagram unless specifically set to display.

## Key Person

A genogram is built around a central individual, known as the **Key Person**. This person is the focal point of the diagram and is visually distinguished by a double-lined border around their symbol.

## Gender

Each person is represented by a shape that indicates their gender. The primary options are **male** and **female**, but other gender representations may be available depending on customization settings.

## Extra

In the **Extra** section, there is a dropdown menu where you can assign special symbols to the person, representing specific life events or circumstances. Options include:
- **Foster Child**
- **Adopted**
- **Pregnant**
- **Miscarriage**
- **Abortion**
- **Stillbirth**
- **Twins**
- **Identical Twins**
- **Pet**

These symbols allow for greater detail in the genogram, giving a more complete view of family structures and individual circumstances.

## Birthday / Age

The **birthday** is important for determining the birth order of children within the diagram. Children are displayed in sequence, with the oldest on the left and the youngest on the right. If the exact birthday isn't available, you can enter the **age** instead. For more information, see the [Birthday](birthday.md) section.

## Passed Away

If the person is deceased, you can check the **Passed Away** option. This will update the symbol with a cross, indicating the individual has passed away.

## Date of Death

Once the **Passed Away** option is selected, an additional field for the **Date of Death** becomes visible. Here, you can enter the exact date the person passed away.

## Medical

In the **Medical** section, you can select one or more illnesses associated with the person. This helps track any relevant medical history for the individual, contributing to a more comprehensive view of the family's medical background.

## Groups

A person can be assigned to one or more groups within the genogram. This feature helps organize related individuals into specific categories or units. For more information on how to create and manage groups, see the [Groups](groups.md) section.
