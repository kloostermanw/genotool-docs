# Teams

GenoTool uses teams to organize users and drawings. Every user has a personal team, and additional teams can be created for collaboration.

## Your Personal Team

When you register for GenoTool, a personal team is automatically created for you. This is your default workspace where you can create and manage your own drawings.

## Creating a Team

To create a new team for collaboration:

1. Click on your name in the top-right corner.
2. Select **Create Team**.
3. Enter a name for the team.
4. Click **Save**.

The new team appears in your team list and you are its owner.

## Team Roles

Each team member has a role that determines what they can do:

| Role | Permissions |
|------|------------|
| **Owner** | Full control over the team, including managing members, settings, and subscription. |
| **Admin** | Can manage team members and settings. |
| **Write** | Can view and edit drawings within the team. |
| **Read** | Can view drawings but cannot make changes. |

## Inviting Team Members

To invite someone to your team:

1. Navigate to the team settings.
2. Click **Invite Member**.
3. Enter the email address of the person you want to invite.
4. Select the role to assign (default: Write).
5. Click **Send Invitation**.

An email invitation is sent to the specified address. The invitation contains a link to accept and join the team.

!!! note
    The number of team members you can invite depends on your subscription plan. See [Subscriptions](subscriptions.md) for details.

## Accepting an Invitation

When you receive a team invitation:

- If you already have a GenoTool account, click the link in the email to join the team.
- If you are new to GenoTool, the link takes you to the registration page where you can create an account and automatically join the team.

## Managing Team Members

As a team owner or admin, you can:

- View all team members and their roles.
- Change a member's role.
- Remove members from the team.
- Resend invitations that have not yet been accepted.

## Child Teams

On the **Large Team** plan, you can create child teams (sub-teams) within your main team:

- Child teams inherit the parent team's subscription.
- This allows you to organize larger groups into smaller working units.
- Each child team can have its own members and drawings.

## Switching Teams

If you are a member of multiple teams, you can switch between them:

1. Click on your name in the top-right corner.
2. Select the team you want to switch to from the dropdown.

The drawing overview will update to show the drawings of the selected team.
